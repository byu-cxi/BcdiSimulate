# BcdiSimulate.jl Documentation

## About

Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) Simulate implements methods to simulate the BCDI problem. Currently, BcdiSimulate only implements atomic scale methods, we may expand these capabilities. 

Currently, this entire package must be run with access to GPUs. This may change in the future (especially if Issues requesting it are opened), but for our research group, using GPUs is a necessity.

## Installation

BcdiSimulate.jl is not registered in the Julia general registry and can be installed by running in the REPL package manager (```]```):

```
add https://github.com/byu-cxi/BcdiMeso.jl.git
```
